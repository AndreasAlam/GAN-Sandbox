# GAN-Sandbox
Standard GAN implemented on top of keras/tensorflow enabling rapid experimentation & research. Branches correspond to stable implementations of GAN architectures (i.e. ACGan, InfoGAN) and other promising variations of GANs (i.e. [GAN hacks](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks.git), local adversarial loss, etc...).

## Guidelines
The `master` branch serves as a simple, clean and robust starting point for GAN R&D. Contributions are encouraged in the form of new branches and/or improvements to `master`. Ideally branches will follow `master's` coding style and deviate as little as possible from it.

## Branches
`master`: Standard GAN.  
`ac-gan`: Auxiliary classifier GAN as described in: [CONDITIONAL IMAGE SYNTHESIS WITH AUXILIARY CLASSIFIER GANS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09585.pdf).

#### About Waya.ai
Waya.ai is a company whose vision is a world where medical conditions are addressed early on, in their infancy. This approach will shift the health-care industry from a constant fire-fight against symptoms to a preventative approach where root causes are addressed and fixed. Our first step to realize this vision is easy, accurate and available diagnosis. Our current focus is concussion diagnosis, recovery tracking & brain health monitoring. Please get in contact with me if this resonates with you!
