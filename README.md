# GAN-Sandbox
Vanilla GAN implemented on top of keras/tensorflow enabling rapid experimentation &amp; research. Branches correspond to stable implementations of GAN architectures (i.e. ACGan, InfoGAN) and other promising variations of GANs (i.e. [GAN hacks](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks.git), local adversarial loss, etc...).
